# Horiseon-Accessibility-Project

# Project Description
This project was executed to refactor, as in improving and correcting, the semantics of an existing HTML codebase. Refactoring ultimately bettered the accessibility of the website, allowed for a cleaner and clearer structure, and updated the code to adhere to the latest standards of web development. By doing so, we also allow for the optomization of this webpage for search engines. Along with this, the enhancement of the code's accessibility ensures the inclusion of disabled users who may use screen-readers, video captions and brail keyboards.
